I first created a form for text input and to submit information.
I used my styles.css just to center my information to make it look cleaner. 
I used the pokemon class and this. function to define the pokemon class and 
data that I wanted to fetch from the API. 
The render card function displays a card with the given pokemon information. 
The async function fetches pokemon data by name. If the pokemon doesn't exist it returns
an error message.
The eventListener waits for the page to load and finds the respective areas on the page. 
Fetch pokemon fetches the info from the API.
